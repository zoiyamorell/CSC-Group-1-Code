-HAM_SIFT100: Zoiya's Downsampled HAM with 100 SIFT points, image augmentation, and SIFT hyperparameter adjustment
-HAM_Best_CNN: Zoiya's 68% accurate HAM CNN model that for some reason gets terrible results with a nearly identical model in SIFT100. Much messier code that also shows some troubleshooting steps.
-DatapreprocessingHAM10k(Farah): Farah's HAM10k data preprocessing code.
-ModelsTrainingHAM10k(Farah): Farah's HAM10k models.
-HEp-2 jupyter Jeremy Ryan: Contains Jeremy and Ryan's SIFT, SVM, and CNN code for HEp-2
-Siftfull: Drew's code for MNIST SIFT
